        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response:</p>I hope to learn enough to be able to add some special code to personalize my Squarespace website template.

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are your initial thoughts on flex box vs grid? Are you drawn to one more than the other?</p>
        <p>Response:</p> It seems like flexbox is better because it is sort of content-aware. </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?"
        </p>
        <p>Response:</p> I will be doing a website featuring a few low light houseplants. I will show care instructions, characteristics, light levels etc. Each page will have a diff layout but with same typography treatment and cohesive color theme. The menus will also be in the same spot for all pages. I will use a dayglo or neon color scheme to emphasize the dark/low-light nature of the subject matter.

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website and write about them.</p>
        <p>Response:I think someone who would use this website is someone similar to me. They are working or going to school from home due to covid and just spending most of their time at home. Maybe as the summer has died down, they are feeling like they want to bring some greenery indoors. A lot of college students live in dorms or apartments without much light and may not think a plant will live. Or maybe they just don't think they have a green thumb or have killed a few plants before. </p>
