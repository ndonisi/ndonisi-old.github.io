        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are your initial thoughts on flex box vs grid? Are you drawn to one more than the other?</p>
        <p>Response:</p> It seems like flexbox is better because it is sort of content-aware. </p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt:What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?"
        </p>
        <p>Response:</p> I will be doing a website featuring a few low light houseplants. I will show care instructions, characteristics, light levels etc. Each page will have a diff layout but with same typography treatment and cohesive color theme. The menus will also be in the same spot for all pages. I will use a dayglo or neon color scheme to emphasize the dark/low-light nature of the subject matter.

        <h2>Week Four</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website and write about them.</p>
        <p>Response:I think someone who would use this website is someone similar to me. They are working or going to school from home due to covid and just spending most of their time at home. Maybe as the summer has died down, they are feeling like they want to bring some greenery indoors. A lot of college students live in dorms or apartments without much light and may not think a plant will live. Or maybe they just don't think they have a green thumb or have killed a few plants before. </p>

        <h2>Week Six</h2>
        <p>Prompt:Write a Project 2 brief. What are your plans? Why have you choses your particular subject. What are three things you hope to improve/highlight with the new design? What interactions are you considering?</p>
        <p>Response:I chose Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon, they are a great organization that helps trap-neuter-release feral cats all on donations and volunteer time. I think the current website is extremely cookie cutter and seems a bit dated. It doesn't reflect the work that the organziation does. I used to volunteer with them and its a very grassroots community feel with a lot of young people volunteering their time. The city has abandoned the feral cat issue and this organization fights to humanely help the problem. Something about it reminds me of the sort of underground work people do in the zine world, so i decided to channel that look and add some color. I also found the links a little hard to find. They should be lumped into the most important reasons people visit: making an appointment, volunteering, donations etc. and then all other resources in another area.

        <h2>Week Eight</h2>
        <p>Prompt: Thoughts on mobile responsiveness design article: I really found myself taking a step back with my project 2 website after reading this article. It makes a lot of sense to design for the lower broswer first. The concept of "progressive advancement" definitely seems to make more sense to me than "Progressive Advancement". Even though I think our natural tendencies are to design desktop first. I am willing to bet the next generation of designers will intuitively design mobile first because now everybody has smartphones and might not even own a desktop computer. </p>

        <p>Prompt: Why do you want to be a designer? </p>
        <p>Response: I want to be a designer:
          To make an impact with creative solutions. Why do I  want use design to make an impact? Its becoming more clear that the way things are designed are increasingly driving how people act in our society. I belive design can be is a very strong tool change.</p>
